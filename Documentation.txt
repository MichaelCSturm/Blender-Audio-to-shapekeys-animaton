WHEELS / MODULES

        IN powershell use
        pip download <package name> --dest ./wheels --only-binary=:all: -python-version=<version> --platform=<platform>
        THEN update the blender_manifest.toml wheels section
        if the command pip doesnt work try pip3. If that doesnt work reinstall python and enable global environmental variables.
        MAKE SURE license is allowed for use. I would use SpeechRecognition as an addon with google pinging but we can't have nice things

GRABING PANEL PROPS:
        Set up a variable in a class and have whenver the update function called update that variable.

SETTING PANEL PROPS:
        Use something like this: bpy.context.scene.my_custom_props.Output = text
        takes the property group pointer and sets the actual data to whatever you want. BE SURE ITS THE RIGHT TYPE THO

USING CONTEXT OVERRIDES. USE THE TEMPARY ONES LIKE. OLD VERISONS ARE DEPRECATED FROM 3.0
